## Project Overview
### Introduction:
The "World Energy Consumption Analysis" project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of global energy consumption patterns using the dataset provided by Our World in Data. This dataset, regularly updated, offers key metrics on energy consumption, energy mix, electricity mix, and other relevant factors, making it an invaluable resource for understanding the current state and trends in global energy use.


## Objectives:
The primary objectives of the World Energy Consumption Analysis project are:
- Identify the top 10 countries by total energy consumption.
- Determine the top 10 countries by electricity generation.
- Identify the top 10 countries by GDP and population.
- Identify the top 10 countries by energy consumption per GDP.
- Identify the top 10 countries by energy consumption per capita.
- Evaluate trends in energy consumption by year.
- Assess trends in carbon intensity by year.
- Identify the top 10 countries by renewable energy consumption.
- Identify the top 10 countries by solar energy consumption.
- Identify the top 10 countries by wind energy consumption.
- Identify the top 10 countries by biofuel consumption.
- Identify the top 10 countries by gas consumption.
- Identify the top 10 countries by fossil fuel consumption.
- Identify the top 10 countries by coal consumption.


  ### Expectations:
- Gain insights into the global distribution of energy consumption.
- Understand the leading countries in electricity generation.
- Correlate energy consumption with economic and population data.
- Evaluate energy efficiency by comparing energy consumption per GDP.
- Analyze energy consumption patterns on a per capita basis.
- Observe historical trends in global energy consumption.
- Track changes in the carbon intensity of electricity generation.
- Identify leaders in renewable energy adoption.
- Understand the contributions of solar energy by top countries.
- Analyze wind energy consumption among leading countries.
- Evaluate the use of biofuels in top-consuming countries.
- Assess gas consumption patterns across top countries.
- Examine the global distribution of fossil fuel consumption.
- Identify major coal-consuming countries.
- Understand the role of nuclear energy in top countries.
- Highlight countries leading in low-carbon energy adoption.
- Assess the importance of hydro energy among top countries.



### About The Dataset
This dataset is a collection of key metrics maintained by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy). It is updated regularly and includes 
data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix, and 
other relevant metrics. The dataset is made up of a table with 130 fields. The Energy consumption (primary energy, energy mix and energy intensity) fields data is sourced from a combination of two sources—the[BP Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics.html) and [SHIFT Data Portal](https://www.theshiftdataportal.org/energy). The Electricity consumption (electricity consumption, and electricity mix) fields are sourced from a combination of two sources: the [BP Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics.html) and [EMBER – Global Electricity](https://ember.shinyapps.io/GlobalElectricityDashboard/).
The other variables are collected from a variety of sources (United Nations, World Bank, 
Gapminder, Maddison Project Database, etc.). More information is available in [our codebook](https://github.com/owid/energy-data/blob/master/owid-energy-codebook.csv)
